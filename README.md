# Week 7 Independent Code Review - Pierre's Bakery in C#

#### This program is a C# console app. It uses two classes, "Bread" and "Pastry". A user can specify how many loaves of bread and how many pastries they want, and the app will return the price. The Bakery offers deals based on how much bread and pastry the customer orders.

## Description
A user should be able to tell how much bread and pasty is worth, be informed about special offers, and then enter an amount for bread and/or pastry. Based on how many units they order, they will be shown how much they owe, sans any "buy-two-get-one-free" type of deals (i.e. if they get two loaves of bread for $10, they get the third one free; not for $15). The user should be welcomed upon launching the app, and any non-integers or unexpected entries should be handled with an error statement. The app should restart from a certain point, instead of canceling at end of run or in event of an error.
